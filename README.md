<h4> Overview of Diabetes</h4>
Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that is usually characterized by high blood sugar levels, which can lead to other complications if left untreated. According to the International Diabetes Federation, the global prevalnce of diabetes in 2021 was 537million adults are living with diabetes which is about 10% of the total global adult population.
<h4> Dataset</h4>
This dataset was gotten from Kaggle through the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 
<h4>Objective</h4>
The objective of the dataset is to eliminate the people who are susceptible to having diabetes within the nearest future in order not to impede the result of the clinical trial a pharmaceutical firm is about to embark on. As as data scientist, I was approached to create 
a model to help predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
<h4>Steps taken to create the model</h4>
Import the diabetes data 
2. check whether it has null values 
3. check how many rows and columns the dataset has 
4. check each column datatype 
5. generate statistics for each column 
6. check the data imbalanace 
7. explore each variable and identify the shape and outliers 
8. Create Scatterplot for each varible to visualize relationship 
9. Generate Correlation for each variable 
10. Visualize the correlation 
11. Get an idea how the traget variable is different for each column of diabetic and non diabetic. 
12. create x and y variable for machine learning 
13. split the data in train and test 
14. Run the below mentioned model and find accuracy, classification report and confusion metric a. Logistic Regression b RandomForest c. SVM  
15. Find the variables that impact the most.
